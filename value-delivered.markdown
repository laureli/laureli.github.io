### Selected testimonials

I've had the opportunity to work with clients on a range of topics. Here's some of the feedback that I've received from our work together:

> Laureli's ability to listen, maintain presence, and weave together themes allowed for deep discussion and powerful conclusions. Laureli helped me to reveal certain mindsets that were blockers for change and shape a path towards progress. Her curious nature lends well to a partnership in the coaching space, and I always felt that she was on my team. Through our time together, I was able to reframe things in a way that made it possible to celebrate the small wins while still pushing forward. I would recommend Laureli to anyone looking to further their development in a safe and supportive environment.

### My value add

_Change and transformation are disruptive._

They are also skills that we can develop. As a coach, I work with people to evolve their ways of working, develop skills even when it is difficult, and embrace challenges in the face of failure because these create opportunities for dramatic difference in:
- navigating negative experiences
- changing trajectory at work
- feeling empowered and autonomous

I enjoy partnering with my clients to adapt and respond in a dynamic context. Being responsive and exploratory is one of my favorite ways to achieve client goals because as we remove stigma and fear, we are able to address blockers that have prevented you from already reaching the next step.

My work adds value to clients by helping to:
- Clarify goals by leveraging thoughtful questions to help you refine and personalize your goals. By creating a goal that you truly own, you can direct your efforts towards it wholeheartedly.
- Generate additional options & paths forward. Some our mental models and their associated assumptions limit our ability to envision the future. By identifying old beliefs that are no longer serving you, you can look forward with confidence and actively engage with all of your opportunities. 

As a coach in these situations, I can act as a socratic partner who brings curiosity, engagement, and a deep investment in your ability to achieve your goals. What I can't do is tell anyone what the right next step is or create a goal that might work for you. 

Instead, our work gives you the tools to create and respond to questions that matter to you.
