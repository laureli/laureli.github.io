My name is Laureli, and I'm fascinated by how we live and work: together, alone, joyfully (or not), reaching our goals, or missing the mark. 

My approach to coaching borrows from my experience helping individuals and teams meet goals, develop and execute on audacious plans, and focus on meaning and happiness at multiple companies. I apply elements from change management, organizational effectiveness, design thinking, and always a collaborative human-centric approach to helping people solve the problems they face today.

I love the discoveries that people have working through challenges with the space, opportunity, and support to engage with what matters in that moment.

## Credentials

- I'm mid-way through the [Organizational and Leadership Coaching Certificate](https://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/masters-learning-and-organizational-change/organizational-leadership-coaching-certification/index.html).
