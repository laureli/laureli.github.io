My name is Laureli, and I'm fascinated by how we live and work: together, alone, joyfully (or not), reaching our goals, or missing the mark. 

___A story about me to help orient you:___
I first noticed the path that lead me to coaching during my first summer of law school. As a clerk for judge in Massachusetts, I was supposed to be having a great experience learning how law was practiced in the court room. I had my own computer, a big window that I could see from my desk, and a couple people who became friends. But I dreaded it. Over the summer, my love of writing and research drained into counting down the weeks until I could go back to what I loved doing more _law school_. Not to be deterred, I finished law school, passed the California Bar Exam, and started working as a lawyer. 

With every accomplishment I was convinced that it would feel better, that I could enjoy this work, but I never gave myself that chance to change my approach or ask why things didn't feel right to me. Instead, I moved on from the law to work in software engineering, computer security, program management with engineering teams, and business operations at my current startup. 

It is easy to tell this story from the lens of my current success (_Look at the change that I've successfully managed!_) but I do wonder where I would be today if I had been able to give myself the space to thrive as a lawyer.
