# Welcome to Idyl Work. 

This is a place to collect my thoughts, resources, and tools as part of my coaching practice.

## Why idyl work?

By embracing the tension  between these two concepts, we can find an optimal balancing point.

*Idyl*: An extremely happy, peaceful, or picturesque episode or scene, typically an idealized or unsustainable one.

*Work*: 
The physical or mental act to do, make or accomplish something. *OR* Something that has been produced or accomplished through effort, activity, or agency.
