# Welcome 

This is a place to collect my thoughts, resources, and tools as part of my coaching learning process as I navigate the Organizational and Leadership Coaching Certificate program at Northwestern University. This website is where I'm 'learning out loud' to reflect on the resources and learnings from this year. This makes the goal of this page both selfish (improving my learning) but also open (explore the content and ask me about it). 

## Why idyl work?

By embracing the tension  between these two concepts, we can find an optimal balancing point.

*Idyl*: An extremely happy, peaceful, or picturesque episode or scene, typically an idealized or unsustainable one.

*Work*: 
The physical or mental act to do, make or accomplish something. *OR* Something that has been produced or accomplished through effort, activity, or agency.

I find myself drawn to the tension between these concepts and want work with people to craft the best possible version of their present and future. Coaching is a tool that may be useful for people to understand their assumptions, identify self-limiting beliefs, and prepare to move through blockers to reach their desired outcomes.
