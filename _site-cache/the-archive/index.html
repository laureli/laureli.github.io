      <li><a href="/general/2021/08/09/categories-of-questions.html">Categories of question</a>: I‚Äôm a curious person and I love a good question. This leads me to ponder questions in the back of my mind while running or to save good questions from other. In my next run, I‚Äôll be thinking about this quote from the 2nd edition of Humble Inquiry, where Edgar...</li>
    
      <li><a href="/trust-building-online">Trust building online</a>: Trust is such an important foundation for working with anyone. The Trusted Advisor has a formula for trust that is described in this video: Trust = (Credibility, Reliability, and Intimacy) / Self-orientation For me, trust is experienced as a physical experience of comfort and stability. This analytic model appeals to...</li>
    
      <li><a href="/boundaries-and-space">Boundaries and space</a>: I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about boundaries while going on long walks. Looking at sidewalks, single track paths, and steep ravines, the boundaries guided me from danger and helped me reach my destinations. While boundaries can be seen as fences that block us from reaching our goals, what if boundaries...</li>

Reasons might be aligned or conflicting between the parties, but each person has an idea of the why for the conversation. As a curiosity-driven person, I can find a why for almost any exploration üç≠ Especially...</li>
    
      <li><a href="/general/2021/05/23/quick-thoughts-on-authenticity-at-work.html">Quick thoughts on authenticity at work</a>: The value of authenticity has become common knowledge in leadership and management literature. On an individual level, authenticity reduces dissonance and may increase well-being. Essentially authenticity makes it easier to be at work. From an organizational perspective, an employee who intentionally conforms rather than acting authentically must direct additional attention...</li>
    
      <li><a href="/general/2021/05/15/threat-vs-reward-what-motivates.html">Threat vs reward: what is motivating this action?</a>: Threat &amp; reward are two poles of a spectrum that individuals and organizations experience. These terms encompass our responses to the full spectrum of experiences from negative to positive. Both threat and reward can be very motivational, but the experience and long term result are not equal. ¬† Threat Reward...</li>
