      <p>There are many approaches to making progress on goals and selecting an approach that feels appropriate can be a great first step on the path.</p>

      <p>I woke up to realize that September is half over. There‚Äôs a lot to be grateful for: where I live, the weather is wonderful this time of year. There‚Äôs also plenty to worry about: <em>where has the year gone? how will I hit the upcoming deadline? what is causing this nervous pit in my stomach?</em></p>

      <p>After reflecting on clients, relationships, and how we can work together, I compiled this image to help set expectations and encourage me to push deeper. I like transforming information from 1 format to another. It gives my brain time to focus on different aspects of the topic at hand.</p>

      <p>I‚Äôm a curious person and love asking questions, but not all questions are equal. <a href="https://positivepsychology.com/coaching-questions/">This article</a> describes powerful questions a tool that ‚Äúignites the imagination ‚Ä¶ and helps to overcome boundaries.‚Äù As a coach, I want to develop skills to ask even better questions for my clients so that they can find their own answers.</p>

      <p>I‚Äôm a curious person and I love a good question. This leads me to ponder questions in the back of my mind while running or to save good questions from other. In my next run, I‚Äôll be thinking about this quote from the <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/humble-inquiry-second/9781523092642/">2nd edition of Humble Inquiry</a>, where Edgar Schein notes:</p>

      <p>Trust is such an important foundation for working with anyone. The Trusted Advisor has a formula for trust that is <a href="https://trustedadvisor.com/why-trust-matters/understanding-trust/understanding-the-trust-equation">described in this video</a>:</p>

      <a href="/boundaries-and-space">Boundaries and space, 07 Jul 2021 </a>
      <p>I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about boundaries while going on long walks. Looking at sidewalks, single track paths, and steep ravines, the boundaries guided me from danger and helped me reach my destinations.</p>

      <a href="/general/micro-blog/2021/07/01/considering-resistance.html">Considering resistance, 01 Jul 2021 </a>
      <p>Resistance is a natural reaction that insulates us from challenge and change. Sometimes resistance helps us persist through difficulty or protects us from risks. But it can outlive those difficulties and become a habit that reduces our ability to achieve goals. Resistance takes many forms and can play on our strengths, like curiosity, problem solving, and common sense, to make it safe to continue without changing our patterns.</p>

      <a href="/coaching-with-consulting-models">Coaching with consulting models, 30 Jun 2021 </a>
      <p>Edgar Schein describes 3 models of working with clients in his article ‚ÄúWhat is process consultation?‚Äù</p>

      <a href="/general/2021/06/15/what-is-the-why.html">What is the why?, 15 Jun 2021 </a>
      <p>Many conversations start with an initial and maybe implicit question: why are we talking? Reasons might be aligned or conflicting between the parties, but each person has an idea of the <em>why</em> for the conversation. As a curiosity-driven person, I can find a why for almost any exploration üç≠</p>

      <a href="/general/2021/05/23/quick-thoughts-on-authenticity-at-work.html">Quick thoughts on authenticity at work, 23 May 2021 </a>
      <p>The value of authenticity has become common knowledge in leadership and management literature. On an individual level, authenticity reduces dissonance and may increase well-being. Essentially authenticity makes it easier to be at work. From an organizational perspective, an employee who intentionally conforms rather than acting authentically must direct additional attention and energy to managing their relationships and interactions at work. Conforming also minimizes the perspectives and information that could improve decision making.</p>

      <a href="/general/2021/05/15/threat-vs-reward-what-motivates.html">Threat vs reward: what is motivating this action?, 15 May 2021 </a>
      <p>Threat &amp; reward are two poles of a spectrum that individuals and organizations experience. These terms encompass our responses to the full spectrum of experiences from negative to positive. Both threat and reward can be very motivational, but the experience and long term result are not equal.</p>
