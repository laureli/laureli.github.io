&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;üí°&lt;em&gt;Something to consider:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Our current work culture in the USA frequently encourages us to always do more, work harder, and keep pushing. While there are times when pushing is the best next step, sometimes making a transformative change is more accessible when using a new approach that challenges our assumed ways of working.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This might even include doing less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost everyone has encountered a SMART goal. From a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;get shit done&lt;/code&gt; perspective, what‚Äôs not to like about a system that encourages us to set goals that are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Specific What will be accomplished? What actions will you take?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Measurable What data will measure the goal? (How much? How well?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Achievable Is the goal doable? Do you have the necessary skills and resources?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Relevant How does the goal align with broader goals? Why is the result important?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Time-Bound &lt;em&gt;**&lt;/em&gt;What is the time frame for accomplishing the goal?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let‚Äôs get beyond SMART and think about frameworks that embrace us as humans in a specific context. By considering our motivations, experience, and context as we set a goal, we can increase our likelihood of succeeding &lt;em&gt;in the way that we want to succeed&lt;/em&gt; rather than being unsatisfied when we achieve the goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An alternative that‚Äôs useful is POSITIVE, a model that draws on a cognitive behavioral therapy approach. POSITIVE‚Äôs granularity can help you review multiple factors that impact your ability to achieve your goals. Here are some examples of key questions in each step:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Purpose: What is it you want to achieve?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Observations: What have you tried so far?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Strategy: What does success look like for you?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Insight: How committed are you in achieving this goal on a scale of 1 ‚Äì 10?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Team: Who will you share your goal with?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Initiate: When will you start to act on this?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Value: How will you celebrate your success?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Encourage: How are you going with your goals?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to SMART, POSITIVE immediately encourages you to think about more than just &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;How will I execute on this goal?&lt;/code&gt; It also makes POSITIVE a useful tool to assess whether this goal should be continued or modified as you work towards completion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve used POSITIVE with a long-term project at several key moments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As I‚Äôm considering a project, I‚Äôll use this framework to identify areas that require additional work before I start. For example, I might be clear on how I‚Äôll measure success, but not sure who is available to team with me to reach the goal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mid-way towards a goal, I like to review POSITIVE to see what‚Äôs changed. Do I have new information and observations that change my delivery timeline? Do I feel more or less certain that I‚Äôll achieve this goal?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At the end, I lean into how I planned to celebrate the success. This helps me avoid situations where I‚Äôm so grateful to be done that I sweep difficult work under a carpet and forget about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do my questions in different arenas, relationships, and topics focus on context or content?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presence is defined by the dictionary as: &lt;em&gt;‚Äúthe state or fact of existing, occurring, or being present in a place or thing.‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; Alternatively the &lt;a href=&quot;https://coachingfederation.org/core-competencies&quot;&gt;International Coaching Federation&lt;/a&gt; defines presence as &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúAbility to be fully conscious and create spontaneous relationship with the client, employing a style that is open, flexible and confident.‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presence feels fully distinct from ‚Äúbeing present‚Äù which is something that is done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current thoughts are that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Presence is a shared experience that we can experience if we create the space and opportunity to connect&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Presence can be given by one person to another&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Presence creates the possibility to discover by allowing the unexpected to happen&lt;/li&gt;

Sometimes resistance helps us persist through difficulty or protects us from risks. But it can outlive those difficulties and become a habit that reduces our ability to achieve goals. Resistance takes many forms and can play on our strengths, like curiosity, problem solving, and common sense, to make it safe to continue without changing our patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My most common form of resistance takes the form of continuously looking for more information. This often takes the form of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;seeking more details&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;searching for the perfect solution&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;believing that resolution can be discovered through additional research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This perpetual hunt for details and information stops me from applying what I already know, which is often enough to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resistance occurs from time to time during coaching as clients work towards goals. We can move through resistance together by recognizing it is happening, making a plan to engage with the resistance, and creating space for the client to address it with courage and without judgment.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="general" /><category term="micro-blog" /><category term="olcc" /><category term="learning" /><summary type="html">Resistance is a natural reaction that insulates us from challenge and change.

&lt;p&gt;In the Process Consultation Model, coach and client will work together 50/50 from initial discovery and diagnosis. Instead of solving problems for the client, the process consultant teaches the client how to solve their own problems and supports them through the process. Schein notes that ‚Äúexpertise is less relevant than‚Ä¶ the skills of involving the client in self-diagnosis and helping‚Ä¶ find a remedy that fits his particular situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schein notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Process Consultation is the creation of a relationship with the client that &lt;em&gt;permits the client to perceive, understand, and act&lt;/em&gt; on the process events that occur in the client‚Äôs internal and external environment in order to improve the situation as defined by the client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Expertise Model emphasizes specialized knowledge and applying highly technical skills to a client who has already appropriately diagnosed a problem (Schein, 1999, p 7). The expert model allows a consultant to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Show targeted specialization in a narrow, highly specific field&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus on providing a specific solution without participating in diagnosis&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Assess the outcome effectively for the client using their expertise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Doctor-Patient model envisions a role that assesses the situation to create a diagnosis which is shared with the patient/client to select the most appropriate treatment plan (Schein, 1999, p 11). The consultant may administer the prescribed response, but will certainly provide a highly detailed presentation of findings and recommendations to show their value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My questions are: How can I balance these different models to best support my clients? How will I get feedback about what is working or not? How can I continuously increase my skills across these models to be optimally effective?&lt;/p&gt;
