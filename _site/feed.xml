&lt;p&gt;As a coaching client, I struggle when I’m told  that “the answer is inside you the whole time.” Perhaps powerful questions can unlock those answers that actually ARE present for each client? Can I be an interlocutor to help people unlock their own personal truths?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If yes, how can I ask the right question at the right time to help people find answers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Keeping up with the content of accelerating change is really hard. … Yet trying to keep up with the content of accelerating change may actually be less important than keeping up with the context of accelerating change. There is a real difference between the content question “What changed?” and the context question “What is going on?” or “Why is this happening?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next weeks, I’ll be asking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do my questions in different arenas, relationships, and topics focus on context or content?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When does a context questions feel more natural?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presence is defined by the dictionary as: &lt;em&gt;“the state or fact of existing, occurring, or being present in a place or thing.”&lt;/em&gt; Alternatively the &lt;a href=&quot;https://coachingfederation.org/core-competencies&quot;&gt;International Coaching Federation&lt;/a&gt; defines presence as &lt;em&gt;“Ability to be fully conscious and create spontaneous relationship with the client, employing a style that is open, flexible and confident.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presence feels fully distinct from “being present” which is something that is done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current thoughts are that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Presence is a shared experience that we can experience if we create the space and opportunity to connect&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Presence can be given by one person to another&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Presence creates the possibility to discover by allowing the unexpected to happen&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trust = (Credibility, Reliability, and Intimacy) / Self-orientation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While boundaries can be seen as fences that block us from reaching our goals, what if boundaries create safe spaces for us to act in alignment with our needs and wants?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By creating boundaries, can I ask a coach create a space for my client to step in and own the resolution of a problem? Will this feel like withholding help or will it feel like holding space for the client to step in take up the space?&lt;/p&gt;

Sometimes resistance helps us persist through difficulty or protects us from risks. But it can outlive those difficulties and become a habit that reduces our ability to achieve goals. Resistance takes many forms and can play on our strengths, like curiosity, problem solving, and common sense, to make it safe to continue without changing our patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My most common form of resistance takes the form of continuously looking for more information. This often takes the form of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;seeking more details&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;searching for the perfect solution&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;believing that resolution can be discovered through additional research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This perpetual hunt for details and information stops me from applying what I already know, which is often enough to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resistance occurs from time to time during coaching as clients work towards goals. We can move through resistance together by recognizing it is happening, making a plan to engage with the resistance, and creating space for the client to address it with courage and without judgment.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="general" /><category term="micro-blog" /><category term="olcc" /><category term="learning" /><summary type="html">Resistance is a natural reaction that insulates us from challenge and change.

&lt;p&gt;In the Process Consultation Model, coach and client will work together 50/50 from initial discovery and diagnosis. Instead of solving problems for the client, the process consultant teaches the client how to solve their own problems and supports them through the process. Schein notes that “expertise is less relevant than… the skills of involving the client in self-diagnosis and helping… find a remedy that fits his particular situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schein notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Process Consultation is the creation of a relationship with the client that &lt;em&gt;permits the client to perceive, understand, and act&lt;/em&gt; on the process events that occur in the client’s internal and external environment in order to improve the situation as defined by the client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Expertise Model emphasizes specialized knowledge and applying highly technical skills to a client who has already appropriately diagnosed a problem (Schein, 1999, p 7). The expert model allows a consultant to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Show targeted specialization in a narrow, highly specific field&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus on providing a specific solution without participating in diagnosis&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Assess the outcome effectively for the client using their expertise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Doctor-Patient model envisions a role that assesses the situation to create a diagnosis which is shared with the patient/client to select the most appropriate treatment plan (Schein, 1999, p 11). The consultant may administer the prescribed response, but will certainly provide a highly detailed presentation of findings and recommendations to show their value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My questions are: How can I balance these different models to best support my clients? How will I get feedback about what is working or not? How can I continuously increase my skills across these models to be optimally effective?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially during the intake process for coaching, I want to be guided by the client’s interest, needs, pacing, and questions.

How can I avoid power struggles and not direct conversations to answer questions I find fascinating, but that might not serve my clients?&lt;/p&gt;

On an individual level, authenticity reduces dissonance and may increase well-being. Essentially authenticity makes it easier to be at work. From an organizational perspective, an employee who intentionally conforms rather than acting authentically must direct additional attention and energy to managing their relationships and interactions at work. Conforming also minimizes the perspectives and information that could improve decision making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leaves us all to evaluate how much of ourselves to bring to any situation. &lt;a href=&quot;https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_to_be_more_authentic_at_work&quot;&gt;Patricia Faison Hewlin&lt;/a&gt; writes: “Authenticity is not really about exuding everything and baring your soul all the time. It’s about identifying what’s important to you and determining how much you can integrate those values into your work life or other areas, so that you can experience life satisfaction, feel engaged, and make a positive contribution to work and society.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this framing, authenticity can be a concept that empowers you by identifying your values and core beliefs. With this self-knowledge, you can make intentional decisions about what authenticity means for you at the moment. It also prepares you if values conflicts arise; self-knowledge can improve clarity about which of your values was affected by a particular experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizations can take explicit steps that enable individuals to exist more authentically at work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Embrace different experiences, opinions, and perspectives.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Highlight positive outcomes that do not require agreement and consensus.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make it safe for people to disagree, make mistakes, and fail when they learn from the process.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create time for reflection and learning at work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every individual and organization will have different approaches to authenticity. Regardless of the starting point, it is possible to learn new skills and develop strategies to align your experience of authenticity with your current and future needs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="general" /><category term="olcc" /><category term="micro-blog" /><category term="quick" /><summary type="html">The value of authenticity has become common knowledge in leadership and management literature.
