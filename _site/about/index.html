<h1 id="about-laureli">About Laureli</h1>

<p>My name is Laureli. I work in tech in San Francisco. I’ve worked on a variety of teams in roles that emphasized privacy, security, engineering, and policy. Through these roles, I’ve been fascinated by how we work together and why some teams succeed when others miss the mark.</p>

<p>Over multiple companies and teams, my interest in learning kept growint and has lead me to pursue a master’s degree in Learning and Organizational Change at Northwestern University. At the <a href="http://msloc.northwestern.edu">MSLOC program</a> I’m studying organizational effectiveness, human systems, design thinking, and developing specific skills that I want to develop and improve.</p>

<p>Of note from MSLOC:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In May 2020, I completed the <a href="https://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/masters-learning-and-organizational-change/designing-for-organizational-effectiveness-certification/index.html">Designing for Organizational Effectiveness Certificate</a>. During this year long program, I performed research into a topic where my client organization was struggling. I then used design thinking to develop a user-centric solution.</p>
  </li>

    <p>In March 2021, I started the <a href="https://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/masters-learning-and-organizational-change/organizational-leadership-coaching-certification/index.html">Organizational and Leadership Coaching Certificate</a> program.</p>
