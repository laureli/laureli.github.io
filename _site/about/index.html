<p>My name is Laureli, and I’m fascinated by how we work: together, alone, joyfully (or not), succeeding, or missing the mark. I’ve pursued this interest across a variety of teams and roles at companies numbering in the low hundreds to hundreds of thousands employees.</p>

<p>Across multiple technology companies and teams, my interest in this topic kept growing and has lead me to pursue a master’s in Learning and Organizational Change at Northwestern University. During the <a href="http://msloc.northwestern.edu">MSLOC program</a> I’m studying organizational effectiveness, human systems, design thinking, and developing specific skills that I want to develop and improve.</p>

<p>An element of the MSLOC program is “learning out loud,” and this is a driving force behind this website.</p>

<p>Of note from MSLOC:</p>

    <p>In May 2020, I completed the <a href="https://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/masters-learning-and-organizational-change/designing-for-organizational-effectiveness-certification/index.html">Designing for Organizational Effectiveness Certificate</a>. During this year long program, I performed research into a topic where my client organization was struggling. I then used design thinking to develop a user-centric solution.</p>
