## Tool 1: Making implicit explicit

This image summarizes some of the tensions that exist in a coaching practice:
- the possibility of change and resistance
- communication styles and presence

During reflection on coaching in late August 2021, I realized that I find myself balancing these questions internally during coaching sessions. With this image / framework, I want to make it more explicit and  open to discussion during coaching sessions.

## Tool 2: SCARF

Despite the slightly cheesey acronym, SCARF is a useful model for parsing the tradeoffs between threat & reward.

S: *Status* refers to relative importance to others

C: *Certainty* relates to predicting the future & understanding possible risks

A: *Autonomy* describes one's sense of control over self and events

R: *Relatedness* details connections and relationships that can create or destroy safety with others

F: *Fairness* is the perceived fair exchange between people

By using these elements to navigate a situation, we can gain insight into positive resonance or negative pressures.
