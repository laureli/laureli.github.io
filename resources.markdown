Let's dig in together.

## Tool 1: Making implicit explicit

This image summarizes some of the tensions that exist in a coaching practice:
- the possibility of change and resistance
- communication styles and presence

During reflection on coaching in late August 2021, I realized that I find myself balancing these questions internally during coaching sessions. With this image / framework, I want to make it more explicit and  open to discussion during coaching sessions.

## Tool 2: SCARF

Despite the slightly cheesey acronym, SCARF is a useful model for parsing the tradeoffs between threat & reward.

S: *Status* refers to relative importance to others

C: *Certainty* relates to predicting the future & understanding possible risks

A: *Autonomy* describes one's sense of control over self and events

R: *Relatedness* details connections and relationships that can create or destroy safety with others

F: *Fairness* is the perceived fair exchange between people

By using these elements to navigate a situation, we can gain insight into positive resonance or negative pressures. This makes it easier for people to interact with these factors as they become easier to recognize and remember. 

As people gain the ability to recognize different elements, we can ask: How are these elements serving me right now?

## Tool 3: POSITIVE goal setting

You can read [my post on SMART vs. POSITIVE here](https://www.idylwork.com/smart-v-positive).

An alternative that’s useful is POSITIVE, a model that draws on a cognitive behavioral therapy approach. POSITIVE’s granularity can help you review multiple factors that impact your ability to achieve your goals. 

Here are some examples of key questions in each step:

| Elements     | Sample questions                                                   |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Purpose      | What is it you want to achieve?                                    |
| Observations | What have you tried so far?                                        |
| Strategy     | What does success look like for you?                               |
| Insight      | How committed are you in achieving this goal on a scale of 1 – 10? |
| Team         | Who will you share your goal with?                                 |
| Initiate     | When will you start to act on this?                                |
| Value        | How will you celebrate your success?                               |
| Encourage    | How are you going with your goals?                                 |

Compared to SMART, POSITIVE immediately encourages you to think about more than just `How will I execute on this goal?` It also makes POSITIVE a useful tool to assess whether this goal should be continued or modified as you work towards completion.

I’ve used POSITIVE with a long-term project at several key moments:

- As I’m considering a project, I’ll use this framework to identify areas that require additional work before I start. For example, I might be clear on how I’ll measure success, but not sure who is available to team with me to reach the goal.
- Mid-way towards a goal, I like to review POSITIVE to see what’s changed. Do I have new information and observations that change my delivery timeline? Do I feel more or less certain that I’ll achieve this goal?
- At the end, I lean into how I planned to celebrate the success. This helps me avoid situations where I’m so grateful to be done that I sweep difficult work under a carpet and forget about it.
