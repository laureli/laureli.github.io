### Selected testimonials

I've had the opportunity to work with clients on a range of topics. Here's some of the feedback that I've received from our work together:

> I started working with Laureli when I felt really stuck at my job. During our work, I practiced asking hard questions that helped me get more information and make a decisive change when the opportunity arose.
>
> _Senior leader, San Francisco, California_



> Our coaching work has made me feel heard, seen, and grounded. Laureli helped me frame some simple questions into a practice that I can use to stay grounded and in the moment during high pressure meetings. 
>
> _Technical staff, Austin, Texas_


### Value add

I enjoy partnering with my clients to adapt and respond to our ever changing work. Being responsive and exploratory is one of my favorite ways to achieve client goals because as we remove stigma and fear, we are able to address blockers that have prevented you from already reaching the next step.


My work adds value to clients by helping to:
- Clarify goals by leveraging thoughtful questions to help you refine and personalize your goals. By creating a goal that you truly own, you can direct your efforts towards it wholeheartedly.
- Generate additional options & paths forward. Some our mental models and their associated assumptions limit our ability to envision the future. By identifying old beliefs that are no longer serving you, you can look forward with confidence and actively engage with all of your opportunities. 

As a coach in these situations, I can act as a socratic partner who brings curiosity, engagement, and a deep investment in your ability to achieve your goals. What I can't do is tell anyone what the right next step is or create a goal that might work for you. 

Instead, our work gives you the tools to create and respond to questions that matter to you.
