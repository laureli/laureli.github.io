My approach to coaching borrows from my experience helping individuals and teams meet goals, develop and execute on audacious plans, and focus on meaning and happiness at multiple companies. I apply elements from change management, organizational effectiveness, design thinking, and always a collaborative human-centric approach to helping people solve the problems they face today.

I love the discoveries that people have working through challenges with the space, opportunity, and support to engage with what matters in that moment.
