After reflecting on clients, relationships, and how we can work together, I compiled this image to help set expectations and encourage me to push deeper. I like transforming information from 1 format to another. It gives my brain time to focus on different aspects of the topic at hand.

As I look at this, I find myself thinking:

- This is only a snapshot in time of my coaching perspective. How will this table change over the coming months and years?
- In what ways am I not pushing myself to go deeper and stretch further to be an even better coach?
- What components have I forgotten to include? Should I add more content or reprioritize and focus?
