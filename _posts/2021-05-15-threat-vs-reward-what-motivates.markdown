Threat & reward are two poles of a spectrum that individuals and organizations experience. These terms encompass our responses to the full spectrum of experiences from negative to positive. Both threat and reward can be very motivational, but the experience and long term result are not equal.

|  | Threat | Reward |
|-|-|-|
| Individual | - A meeting with a stakeholder throws the future of a multi-year project into doubt - A re-org, the goals and scope of a team have reduced the possibility of growth | - Receiving meaningful recognition for contributing to a project - Experiencing an energizing flow state |
| Organization | - New competition threatens what used to be a stable source of revenue - Rapid growth leads to challenges in organizational effectiveness and employee engagement | - Delivering value for clients in an impactful manner - Overcoming a hardship to unlock new potential |



This gives us a quick heuristic you can use when considering a change or making a plan: What is motivating this change? 
If you are trying to minimize risk, mitigate negative outcomes, and manage uncertainty you are probably acting on a threat response.
If you are maximizing the chance for success, combining multiple perspectives into a complex solution, or embracing change as a new opportunity, then you are probably acting on a reward-based model.

This topic relates to David Rock’s SCARF model, which I’ll dig into more in the future. For more on SCARF, you can read his article [Managing with the brain in mind](https://www.strategy-business.com/article/09306).
