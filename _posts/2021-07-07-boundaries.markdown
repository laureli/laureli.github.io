I've been thinking a lot about boundaries while going on long walks. Looking at sidewalks, single track paths, and steep ravines, the boundaries guided me from danger and helped me reach my destinations.

While boundaries can be seen as fences that block us from reaching our goals, what if boundaries create safe spaces for us to act in alignment with our needs and wants?

By creating boundaries, can I ask a coach create a space for my client to step in and own the resolution of a problem? Will this feel like withholding help or will it feel like holding space for the client to step in take up the space?

I think this area will be an essential topic to discuss with clients as we establish and continuously refine our work together.
