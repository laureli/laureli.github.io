Resistance is a natural reaction that insulates us from challenge and change. Sometimes resistance helps us persist through difficulty or protects us from risks. But it can outlive those difficulties and become a habit that reduces our ability to achieve goals. Resistance takes many forms and can play on our strengths, like curiosity, problem solving, and common sense, to make it safe to continue without changing our patterns.

My most common form of resistance takes the form of continuously looking for more information. This often takes the form of:
* seeking more details
* searching for the perfect solution
* believing that resolution can be discovered through additional research

This perpetual hunt for details and information stops me from applying what I already know, which is often enough to get started.

Resistance occurs from time to time during coaching as clients work towards goals. We can move through resistance together by recognizing it is happening, making a plan to engage with the resistance, and creating space for the client to address it with courage and without judgment.
