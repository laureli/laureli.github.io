Trust is such an important foundation for working with anyone. The Trusted Advisor has a formula for trust that is [described in this video](https://trustedadvisor.com/why-trust-matters/understanding-trust/understanding-the-trust-equation):

Trust = (Credibility, Reliability, and Intimacy) / Self-orientation

For me, trust is experienced as a physical experience of comfort and stability. This analytic model appeals to my brain, but misses the depth of experience. 

I'm not sure how I can use this forumla to be of service to clients - especially as we build relationships in this online world.

My question about trust: How can I build trusting relationships with clients in a purely online world?
