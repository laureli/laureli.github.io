Asking “What would you do if you knew you couldn’t fail?” seems positive, but consider some possible reframes:

- What would you do if failure wasn’t a defeat, bad, or a sign of inability?
- What could you learn if failures gave you additional information?
- What if a failure wasn’t the last step, but an intermediary step on a longer journey?

For those of us who never quite believe that we can’t fail, “What would you do if you knew you couldn’t fail?” the belief that failure has to be avoided. It encourages us to reject failure by not even considering the possibility and sets us up to face risks we haven’t addressed. 

Removing the negativity may require adopting a fresh approach to failure. To avoid cliched statistics, let’s talk about `failure rates`. A failure rate is [the expected number of times that a system or item will fail in a period of time](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/failure-rate). The information about any failure (or lack thereof) contributes to the next iteration of that system or item.

When we reframe failure, some relevant questions become: 

- What can I learn from this failure to improve outcomes the next time?
- Are there failures that I can expect and plan to learn from in the future?
