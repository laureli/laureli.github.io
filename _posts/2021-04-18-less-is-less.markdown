Question of the week: Can I rebalance by letting go and having less of that which isn’t helping me?

I’m tired of the aphorism that *less is more*. After a year of more disease, stress, worry, failing systems, and existential crises, I’ve had so much more. I also replaced many of the things that I lost with more:
- More video calls and social media replaced lost time with friends and family 
- More endless scroll on the internet replaced lost peace of mind
- More sitting has replaced lost physical movement and travel
To not be too gloomy, yes, I’ve gotten more good things as well: more connection with friends who live in other places, more solo hobbies, and more time not commuting.

Despite the potential for swapping A for B, today the balance doesn’t feel right. Over the past year, so much changed and was lost. I filled the vacuum in with things that damped the stress and anxiety. The protection is now constraining me, cutting me off from moving forward.
I’m going to prune what is no longer serving me and replacing it with less to create space for… whatever happens.

In a paper called [People systematically overlook subtractive changes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03380-y), Leidy Klotz writes about the default attractive nature of addition. He posits that not only might addition be incrementally easier for our brains to process, also “Numerical concepts of ‘more’ and ‘higher’ may map to evaluative concepts of ‘positive’ and ‘better ...” and subtraction is a finite process: at some point, you end up with nothing. 

Yet addition can’t solve many of the challenges that we are facing today:
- Too many meeting during the day
- Too much bureaucracy
- Too much time in front of screens (computers or TVs)
- Too many commitments to connect with your family or friends

At the end of last year, I took part in a socially distanced autocross gathering. Autocross consists of timed driving on a closed course that is short (1-2 kilometers) and it emphasizes car handling over speed, courtesy of delightful twists and turns. While the speeds are slow for autosports, a single pass takes less than a minute. 

This was my 3rd time ever autocrossing and I’m new to the world of technical driving. It is physically difficult, mentally demanding, and technically challenging to hustle a car around a tiny course laid out in cones on a parking lot. That morning I was waiting for my next lap thinking about everything that I had to hurry to improve on a tricky corner. *I needed to downshift without losing too much speed, enter on the right, keep the correct throttle position, accelerate out of the turn, exit in a straight line, and finally speed up hard into the next sweeping turn.* Everything about this felt rushed. My hands and feet weren’t in the right place. I was turning in too early, braking too late. I was making it feel hard.

I realized I was assuming I wouldn’t be able to do everything that I needed to do, essentially preparing to fail by planning to fail. My approach to that corner assumed I wasn’t fast enough, didn’t have the skills to shift quickly, and wasn’t consistent enough to drive a good line. So I asked myself, **What would happen if I had enough time to do everything to make this corner perfect?** And with that question in my head, I drove a faster lap than my prior best. The lap also felt easier: I wasn’t rushing into my setup, so I got to the correct place; I gave myself more time to downshift well, so I had more speed when I wanted it. 

Let’s be clear that I am still very much a beginner in autocross, but by letting go of the need to “do more, faster” I made space to do better. I let myself use the skills and experience that I had, rather than feeling the need to do more of something that I didn’t understand. I had made even more improvements, and I was having even more fun.

I’ve been using that question from autocross to help me envision a fresh way of existing with less pressure, less assuming failure, and less focus solely on mitigating the worst potential outcome. 

I’m looking forward to reading Leidy Klotz’s book that I’m waiting to get from the library: [Subtract: The untapped science of less](https://bookshop.org/books/subtract-the-untapped-science-of-less/9781250249869).
