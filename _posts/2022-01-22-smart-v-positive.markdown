There are many approaches to making progress on goals and selecting an approach that feels appropriate can be a great first step on the path.

Almost everyone has encountered a SMART goal. From a `get shit done` perspective, whatâ€™s not to like about a system that encourages us to set goals that are:

- Specific What will be accomplished? What actions will you take?
- Measurable What data will measure the goal? (How much? How well?
- Achievable Is the goal doable? Do you have the necessary skills and resources?
- Relevant How does the goal align with broader goals? Why is the result important?
- Time-Bound ****What is the time frame for accomplishing the goal?

But letâ€™s get beyond SMART and think about frameworks that embrace us as humans in a specific context. By considering our motivations, experience, and context as we set a goal, we can increase our likelihood of succeeding *in the way that we want to succeed* rather than being unsatisfied when we achieve the goal.

An alternative thatâ€™s useful is POSITIVE, a model that draws on a cognitive behavioral therapy approach. POSITIVEâ€™s granularity can help you review multiple factors that impact your ability to achieve your goals. Here are some examples of key questions in each step:

- Purpose: What is it you want to achieve?
- Observations: What have you tried so far?
- Strategy: What does success look like for you?
- Insight: How committed are you in achieving this goal on a scale of 1 â€“ 10?
- Team: Who will you share your goal with?
- Initiate: When will you start to act on this?
- Value: How will you celebrate your success?
- Encourage: How are you going with your goals?

Compared to SMART, POSITIVE immediately encourages you to think about more than just `How will I execute on this goal?` It also makes POSITIVE a useful tool to assess whether this goal should be continued or modified as you work towards completion.

Iâ€™ve used POSITIVE with a long-term project at several key moments:

- As Iâ€™m considering a project, Iâ€™ll use this framework to identify areas that require additional work before I start. For example, I might be clear on how Iâ€™ll measure success, but not sure who is available to team with me to reach the goal.
- Mid-way towards a goal, I like to review POSITIVE to see whatâ€™s changed. Do I have new information and observations that change my delivery timeline? Do I feel more or less certain that Iâ€™ll achieve this goal?
- At the end, I lean into how I planned to celebrate the success. This helps me avoid situations where Iâ€™m so grateful to be done that I sweep difficult work under a carpet and forget about it.
