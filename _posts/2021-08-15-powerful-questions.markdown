I'm a curious person and love asking questions, but not all questions are equal. [This article](https://positivepsychology.com/coaching-questions/) describes powerful questions a tool that "ignites the imagination ... and helps to overcome boundaries." As a coach, I want to develop skills to ask even better questions for my clients so that they can find their own answers.

As a coaching client, I struggle when I'm told  that "the answer is inside you the whole time." Perhaps powerful questions can unlock those answers that actually ARE present for each client? Can I be an interlocutor to help people unlock their own personal truths?

If yes, how can I ask the right question at the right time to help people find answers?

I'm looking forward to years of experimentation before I get anywhere close to mastery on asking powerful questions.
