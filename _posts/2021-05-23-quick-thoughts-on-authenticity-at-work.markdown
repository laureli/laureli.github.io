The value of authenticity has become common knowledge in leadership and management literature. On an individual level, authenticity reduces dissonance and may increase well-being. Essentially authenticity makes it easier to be at work. From an organizational perspective, an employee who intentionally conforms rather than acting authentically must direct additional attention and energy to managing their relationships and interactions at work. Conforming also minimizes the perspectives and information that could improve decision making.

This leaves us all to evaluate how much of ourselves to bring to any situation. [Patricia Faison Hewlin](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_to_be_more_authentic_at_work) writes: “Authenticity is not really about exuding everything and baring your soul all the time. It’s about identifying what’s important to you and determining how much you can integrate those values into your work life or other areas, so that you can experience life satisfaction, feel engaged, and make a positive contribution to work and society.”

In this framing, authenticity can be a concept that empowers you by identifying your values and core beliefs. With this self-knowledge, you can make intentional decisions about what authenticity means for you at the moment. It also prepares you if values conflicts arise; self-knowledge can improve clarity about which of your values was affected by a particular experience.

Organizations can take explicit steps that enable individuals to exist more authentically at work:
- Embrace different experiences, opinions, and perspectives.
- Highlight positive outcomes that do not require agreement and consensus.
- Make it safe for people to disagree, make mistakes, and fail when they learn from the process.
- Create time for reflection and learning at work.

Every individual and organization will have different approaches to authenticity. Regardless of the starting point, it is possible to learn new skills and develop strategies to align your experience of authenticity with your current and future needs.
