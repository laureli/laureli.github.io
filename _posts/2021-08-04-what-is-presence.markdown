And how can I bring presence to the coaching experience?

Presence is defined by the dictionary as: _"the state or fact of existing, occurring, or being present in a place or thing."_ Alternatively the [International Coaching Federation](https://coachingfederation.org/core-competencies) defines presence as _"Ability to be fully conscious and create spontaneous relationship with the client, employing a style that is open, flexible and confident."_

Presence feels fully distinct from “being present” which is something that is done.

My current thoughts are that:

- Presence is a shared experience that we can experience if we create the space and opportunity to connect
- Presence can be given by one person to another
- Presence creates the possibility to discover by allowing the unexpected to happen
