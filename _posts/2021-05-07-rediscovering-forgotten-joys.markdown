*Can we get alienated from our unique definitions of happiness and fulfillment? When we do, how do we discover a new version that is authentically ours?* 

Some days, I have forgotten the experience of the alive version of myself after more than a year of stress, anticipation, and worry. To be honest, I worked with these factors before COVID-19 made these challenges visible and gave so many of us a shared platform to talk about missing pieces.

Martin Seligman describes happiness as a construct of 3 types of wellbeing: _pleasure_, _engagement_, and _meaning_. As described in 
[Unpacking grit: Motivational correlates of perseverance and passion for long-term goals](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6688745/#S1title) (2014 work done in part by Angela Duckworth), each person balances these factors and their interest in _flow_. Each factor has different rewards and requires different activities to achieve it:
- flow-seekers engage concentration that may overcome self-awareness 
- pleasure-seekers can embrace novelty, which can be instantly pleasurable
- meaning-seekers invest time and effort to work towards their definition of a greater good

How do we take this list of abstract concepts and make it relevant to ourselves? This practice is working for me right now:
- Noticing when something is working and what isn’t. Write it down so I can focus on it.
- For each thing, dig deeper into relevant factors: What are you getting? What’s missing?

## An example from my life
Making this website brings me a surprising amount of happiness, something I’ve recently realized. I’m using making intentionally, because IdylWork is:
- a static site I’m building with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) 
- hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) with every change and struggle visible at [https://github.com/laureli/laureli.github.io](https://github.com/laureli/laureli.github.io)
- made with open source & publicly available resources like my theme [Hydeout](https://fongandrew.github.io/hydeout/) and this code that [uses google docs to display comments](https://jdvp.me/articles/Google-Forms-Jekyll-Comments) 

What I _deeply_ love:
- The only money I spent was registering my domain with [Gandi.net](https://gandi.net), a company supporting protections for free speech, privacy, and data security
- There are *NO ADS*. The only analytics (user data collection) on this page are mine and they’re here to ensure uptime & reliability.
- I don’t have to use Wordpress, Wix, Medium or whatever other platform that’s monetize me, my content, and readers. (This is SO satisfying.)

In table form, this might look like:

When I dug deeper into the components of happiness, I remembered more about why these things contribute to my happiness and satisfaction. It also helps me to spot more opportunities to try on and experiment with potential pathways to happiness and fulfillment.

If you try it, let me know what you think in the comments.
