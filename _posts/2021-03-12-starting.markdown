# Hello

## This post is a test.

This post is also a starting point for my work on Northwestern's Organizational and Leadership Coaching Certificate. I'm pursuing it as part of a Master's of Science in Learning and Organizational Change. That's a mouthful, I know. I'll add more detail in the near future.

Right now, I'm testing systems and trying to relearn how to use git, because web hosting providers are more irritating than setting up my own static website.
