I’m a curious person and I love a good question. This leads me to ponder questions in the back of my mind while running or to save good questions from other. In my next run, I’ll be thinking about this quote from the [2nd edition of Humble Inquiry](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/humble-inquiry-second/9781523092642/), where Edgar Schein notes:

> Keeping up with the content of accelerating change is really hard. ... Yet trying to keep up with the content of accelerating change may actually be less important than keeping up with the context of accelerating change. There is a real difference between the content question “What changed?” and the context question “What is going on?” or “Why is this happening?”

Over the next weeks, I’ll be asking:

- Do my questions in different arenas, relationships, and topics focus on context or content?
- When does a context questions feel more natural?
- What questions are impactful for particular clients?
