dgar Schein describes 3 models of working with clients in his article "What is process consultation?" 

In the Process Consultation Model, coach and client will work together 50/50 from initial discovery and diagnosis. Instead of solving problems for the client, the process consultant teaches the client how to solve their own problems and supports them through the process. Schein notes that “expertise is less relevant than… the skills of involving the client in self-diagnosis and helping… find a remedy that fits his particular situation.

Schein notes:

> Process Consultation is the creation of a relationship with the client that *permits the client to perceive, understand, and act* on the process events that occur in the client’s internal and external environment in order to improve the situation as defined by the client.

The Expertise Model emphasizes specialized knowledge and applying highly technical skills to a client who has already appropriately diagnosed a problem (Schein, 1999, p 7). The expert model allows a consultant to:

- Show targeted specialization in a narrow, highly specific field
- Focus on providing a specific solution without participating in diagnosis
- Assess the outcome effectively for the client using their expertise.

The Doctor-Patient model envisions a role that assesses the situation to create a diagnosis which is shared with the patient/client to select the most appropriate treatment plan (Schein, 1999, p 11). The consultant may administer the prescribed response, but will certainly provide a highly detailed presentation of findings and recommendations to show their value.

My questions are: How can I balance these different models to best support my clients? How will I get feedback about what is working or not? How can I continuously increase my skills across these models to be optimally effective?
