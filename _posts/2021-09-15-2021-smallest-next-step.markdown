I woke up to realize that September is half over. There's a lot to be grateful for: where I live, the weather is wonderful this time of year. There's also plenty to worry about: *where has the year gone? how will I hit the upcoming deadline? what is causing this nervous pit in my stomach?*

Next week, I start the Fall Quarter of my coaching program (2 done! 2 to go!). While I love school, the looming deadlines, the exhaustion of learning and practicing new skills, and the ever-changing world sometimes feels like a lot.

In the run up to Day 1, I'll be reminding myself to ask:

> What is the smallest next step that I can take?

In this moment, writing this post is my smallest next step to prepare for school.
