Many conversations start with an initial and maybe implicit question: why are we talking? Reasons might be aligned or conflicting between the parties, but each person has an idea of the *why* for the conversation. As a curiosity-driven person, I can find a why for almost any exploration üç≠

Especially during the intake process for coaching, I want to be guided by the client's interest, needs, pacing, and questions. Does this mean that my curiosity will derail a client's sense of ownership over our conversation? How can I avoid power struggles and not direct conversations to answer questions I find fascinating, but that might not serve my clients?

I want to find ways to channel my curiosity to serve the client's discovery process while being authentic and fully present ... right now this feels like no small task!
